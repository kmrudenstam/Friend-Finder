# Friend-Finder

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

**Technologies used:** CSS, Node.js, Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, Express


**Before you get started, make sure you have these node packages installed:**
1. **Express:** A fast and minimalist web framework for node.

     *Command Line: 'npm install express'*


2. **Path:** - A node package that will allow you to set back end routes to your pages.

     *Command Line: 'npm install path'*

3. **nodemon:** - (*Optional*) A super useful tool when working and testing local servers. This package automatically refreshes your server everytime a change is saved within your code, eliminating the need to manually restart your server when logging changes. The only change the user has to make is when starting your server from the command line, you write *nodemon* rather than  *node* followed by your file name.

    *Command Line: 'npm install nodemon'*
